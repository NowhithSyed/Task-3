Interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing global sales trends, customer performance, and regional revenue distribution
The Global Sales Performance Dashboard was developed in Power BI to provide a comprehensive, interactive analysis of sales data.
It combines KPI cards, charts, and tables to present performance across time, geography, product lines, and customers.
Users can track Total Sales, Total Orders, Average Sales per Order, and Total Revenue at a glance, while detailed visuals such as Sales Over Time (line chart), Sales by City (bar chart), Sales by Territory (pie chart), and Top 5 Customers by Sales highlight key trends and top performers.
A customer-level detailed table supports deeper analysis, and slicers for Year, Country, and City allow for dynamic filtering.
The dashboard delivers actionable insights by revealing revenue patterns, identifying high-value customers, and comparing performance across regions â€” enabling data-driven decision-making.
